# How-LuaU-Works

How does Roblox LuaU Really Work? Well, first, let's start explaning for the new noobs.

Page 1: What is LuaU? (noobs)
Roblox, the gaming platform, has modified lua & created *LuaU*. LuaU has **functions**, one of the functions are called **LuaU_Deserializer**. LuaU can also be used for *Roblox exploiting*.
Let's talk about how it works (exploiting edition). There are currently *2* exploiting execution methods, *Interperter and Transpiler*, which transpiler is widely famous.
LuaU is really Similar to Hex, not **hex** but similar. If you try to Convert Luau to Hex, it won't work properly. It'll replace some parts or something *else*.

Serializer and Deserializer, now think **Decompiler and Compiler**, "de" means to "break down". So *Deserializer* means breaking down the Serialized Script. Do you get it now?
How it serializes? Transpiler compiles up the following string, const char, whatever into LuaU **which roblox can read not normal humans lol**, and deserializes it to roblox.
LuaU is like Roblox's food. Anyways, Deserializer will first break it down into readable format, then give it to roblox with following 5 arguments. (int, ?, ?, ?, ?, int).
